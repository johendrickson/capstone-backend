## Environment Variables & API Keys

This project uses several environment variables to connect to external services (database, email, weather API, AI API, geocoding, etc.).  

For **security reasons**, sensitive values such as API keys, passwords, and database credentials **should never** be committed to the repository. Instead:  

- Store these values in a local `.env` file for local development.  
- Add the keys as **GitHub Repository Secrets** for deployment and CI/CD workflows.  
- Do not post these values publicly, even in screenshots or documentation.

Example `.env` file structure (values are placeholders):

```env
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_PORT=your_db_port
DB_NAME=your_db_name

EMAIL_USER=your_email
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password

OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
LOCATIONIQ_API_KEY=your_locationiq_api_key
```

## Local Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-pal-backend.git

  venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. Install Dependencies
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set Up Environment Variables

    Create a .env file in the project root.

    Copy the variables listed in the Environment Variables section.

    Fill in your own secret values (from secure storage).

5. Run Database Migrations
(Only if you are initializing the database locally)
```bash
  flask db upgrade
```

6. Start the Development Server
